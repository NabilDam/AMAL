# AMAL: Advanced MAchine Learning & Deep Learning

The aim of this course is to cover the following concepts:

### Introduction to deep learning: Course and experimentations on state of the art architectures.
* Deep neural Network architectures
* Convolutional neural network, reccurents neural network.
* Attention models.
* Computational graph and autograd.
* Framework for deeplearning: pytorch, tensor flow and CUDA programmation.

### Deepening of the founding concepts of the machine learning
* Statistical learning theory, generalizability, bias-variance dilemma, PAC, learning complexity, etc.
* Supervised Learning: Classification, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Kernel Methods, Gaussian Processes, etc...
* Optimization
* Unsupervised learning: Clustering, Matrix Factoring, Latent Variable Models (blends, etc.)


### Other learning paradigms :
* Low supervision learning, Semi-supervised and transductive learning, Active learning,
* Transfer Learning
* Learning and structured data: Sequences and trees, Graphs and interdependent data.
